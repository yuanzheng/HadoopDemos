# Page Rank #

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results.

This demo is based on the basic theory behind PageRank:

- More important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.
- Website with higher PageRank will pass higher weight.

And it includes the multiplication of two large matrices with MapReduce.
